### CPSC 120

Project One (Lab #2)

Lab two was my first favorite lab assignment because it introduced strings which was an introduction to actually coding to an extent. We got into VS code where we were simply labeling strings to their meaning, for example “std::string plural_noun{“plural noun”};”. Although it was mostly repetition, it was good practice that I needed as I do not have much coding experience.

Project Two (Lab #6)

Lab six, part one was my second favorite lab assignment as I worked on sandwich.cc where I coded how to order a sandwich. I liked how the code can work as self-serve machine where it asks the customer for exactly three items such as a protein, a bread, and a condiment. What I learned here is that we can use the basic principle of this code to construct a self-serve machine that can make sandwiches; obviusouly regarding it would need the proper hardware and software improvments.

Project Three (Lab #11)

Lab 11, part two was my third favorite lab assignment because we learned how code a higher or lower guessing game where the user only had four guesses. I was able to write functions that might end the code without getting through all of it, if the user guessed correctly, or end after four attempts of guessing.
